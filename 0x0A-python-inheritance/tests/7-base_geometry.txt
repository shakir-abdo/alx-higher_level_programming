Defines a BaseGeometry class called BaseGeometry.

The BaseGeometry class is designed to serve as a foundation for geometric shapes, providing common functionality such as area calculation and integer validation.

Class: BaseGeometry
-------------------
Represents the base geometry class.

Methods:
    - area(self): Method not yet implemented. Raises an Exception.
    - integer_validator(self, name, value): Validates a parameter as an integer.
        Args:
            name (str): The name of the parameter.
            value (int): The parameter to validate.
        Raises:
            TypeError: If value is not an integer.
            ValueError: If value is less than or equal to 0.

Usage Example:
--------------
# Create an instance of BaseGeometry
geometry_instance = BaseGeometry()

# Attempt to call the area method (not yet implemented)
try:
    geometry_instance.area()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Output: "area() is not implemented"

# Validate an integer parameter
try:
    geometry_instance.integer_validator("side_length", 5)
except TypeError as te:
    print(te)  # Output: "side_length must be an integer"
except ValueError as ve:
    print(ve)  # Output: "side_length must be greater than 0"
